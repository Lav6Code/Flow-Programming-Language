# FLOW programming language

FLOW is programming language created for students to learn geometry and programming thinking.

## Installation

To run FLOW you need to install turtle module, that is needed for visual function of the language. To install it is recommended to use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).
```bash
pip install turtle
```

## Executing

To execute your code.flow file, simply go to the FLOW.py directory and run the following command.

```bash
python FLOW.py code.flow
```
## Examples

Examples of code are in **example** folder.

## Hardware

Running FLOW was not tested on any other OS other than Windows, so it is recommended to run it that way. Running it on MacOS should not cause any errors, but still consider using Windows for safety purposes.
